I am a dedicated cybersecurity engineer focused on expanding my expertise in pentesting and security operations center (SOC) practices. I rank in the top 4% on TryHackMe while actively pursuing knowledge in ethical hacking and data science. My diverse skill set spans ethical hacking, data science, 2D animation, coding (Python, C++, MySQL, assembly), and tools like Adobe After Effects, Solidworks, and AutoCAD. 

> This website is a work in progress and will serve as my platform to share insights on cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and related topics. Stay tuned as I continue to build and refine it!
